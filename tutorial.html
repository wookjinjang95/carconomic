                <p style="padding-top: 30px">
                    There is always a “golden” rule when it comes to purchasing a car: never buy it new, always buy it pre-owned. 
                    But why is this the case? The reason why people want to avoid purchasing a new car is to avoid the depreciation, or devaluation, of the vehicle. 
                    In fact, new cars depreciate a lot faster than used cars, with the value dropping roughly 20% after the 
                    first year of ownership then continuing to depreciate around 10% the following year. 
                    After 5 years or so, a car could be worth about half of its initial sticker price. 
                    Depreciation typically slows down after the 5-year mark, and essentially stops once the car reaches the tender age of 10 years [Experian article].  
                    In this tutorial, it will explain how depreciation works and how some cars have slower depreciation rates than others. 
                    To demonstrate how depreciation works on certain cars, we will be using two models: the BMW M3 and M5. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before starting, it will be great if we can collect data first. 
                    We will be collecting data for each BMW M3 and M5 that's currently available on the market. 
                    For example, some websites show miles and price for all BMW M3 and M5. 
                    By collecting all the information, we can see how the market behaves for those specific vehicles.

                    By looking at those two data table side by side, we can see that BMW M5 tends to depreciate
                    more than BMW M3. Despite the depreciation percentage for M3 and M5 might be similar from 5000 miles to 10,000 miles,
                    M5 loses value more than M3. Consequently, we can conclude that each vehicle has its own depreciation.

                    What is the straight line in the graph?
                </div>
                <div>
                    The straight line is called a linear regression, or linear model. 
                    Basically, gathering all the data (dots) in the graph, the linear regression, which is in a straight line, 
                    will show trend of the graph. This trend is basically demonstrating how much will it cost per one mile. 
                    However, this line itself is not useful
                    <mark style="background-color: rgba(255, 145, 0, 0.822)6, 156)">
                        This is just an ideal market where each mile will have fixed cost.
                    </mark>
                    As a consumer, we wish that there is no sudden depreciation and every car has a fixed depreciation rate per each mile.
                    Life would have been so much easier. But that's not the case as we saw in previous data for BMW M3 and M5 depreciation
                    data table. Now let's draw another line called depreciation line or logartihmic regression model.
                </div>
                <div style="font-size: 30px;">What is the depreciation line?</div>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in <a href="#chapter_1">chapter 1</a> about the depreciation, a car's value depreciates faster in 
                    the beginning of couple thousand miles and slows in depreciation rate as you drive more. Let's draw this depreciation line along with 
                    the straight line we drawn before in <a href="#chapter_2">chapter 2</a>. If you check the graph above, there are two
                    lines that's been drawn. <a style="color: red">Red line</a> is the straight line that we mentioned as a linear regression
                    model. The <a style="color: steelblue">blue line</a> is a depreciation line. If you look at the depreciation line,
                    we notices that, in the beginning, the line goes straight down. A lot more slope than any other miles. This shows
                    how the depreciation rate is at highest for brand new cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you go towards 60,000 miles mark on the graph, you notice that the depreication line starts to become linear and less
                    slope. This tells us that the depreciation rate slows down as the car gets driven in a long term period. So the real question
                    is how these two lines combined together in one graph can bring insight to us?

                                The <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 900;">first point</a> is where <a style="color: steelblue">depreciation line</a>
                                and <a style="color: red">straight line</a> meets. That is when depreciation rate starts to slow down. This meams that the vehicle
                                passed the huge depreciation rate phase. For example, BMW M5 biggest depreciation rate stops at 9000 miles with price around
                                88,000 dollars. This tells us that if you are interested in buying pre-owned cars, the best mileage will be to buy BMW M5,
                                in this case, at 9000 miles.

                                Assuming you are the owner of the vehicle, the owner probably lost some money due to early depreciation.
                                It's too late as a seller to recover the money that it losts from early depreciation. At <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 900;">first point</a>,
                                sellers can sell their cars due to high demand from buyers. The demand for a car at first point is the highest compare to other mileage.
                                It will be easy to sell the car at that first point's price and miles. Also if you already owned the vehicle before the first point,
                                please try to sell before the first point meets or passes to avoid losing money from depreication as much as possible.

                                Once the <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 900;">second point</a> comes across, the vehicle pretty much is considered used and going through a phase where
                                things are going to break. There is a reason why the depreciation rate slowed down and becomes linear starting
                                at that the second point due to maintenance cost.
